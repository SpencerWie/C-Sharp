Note that the on-going proccess of this directory has been switched to a private repository. The releases here will be halted for now.

One possiblity is that I will release a *"Demo"* version of the main game as open source in this directory. 

Instead updates to the main game along with it's current progress will be recored here to give an idea where the project is at along with it's documentation.
